Contributions To Deliverable 1

Colton - Contributed by means of attending scheduled meetings on Zoom, 
putting time in figuring out how to begin coding our website, and putting 
out ideas for group members. I was in charge of creating all of the HTML 
and CSS for our clothing pages, which included a Men’s, Women’s, and Kid’s 
page, all individually having their own content. We figured that all pages 
should share a common color scheme and to keep things simple, allow for the 
layout of the pages to be somewhat identical in code. Once all of the HTML and 
CSS was completed for these pages, the zip file containing my work was sent to 
another group member (Thomas) to combine both of our code together, making a 
functioning website.

Thomas - Contributed by means of attending scheduled meetings on Zoom, 
putting time in figuring out how to begin coding our website, and putting 
out ideas for group members. I designed the nav bar for the home page with help 
from w3schools. I am also in charge of the main project folder where we put our code 
together so I created the nav bar for all of the other pages as well. I also used CSS 
and HTML to code the index.html home page. We figured that all pages should share a 
common color scheme and to keep things simple, allow for the layout of the pages to be 
somewhat identical in code. Once all of the HTML and CSS was completed for these pages, 
Colton and I worked to put the webisite together.

Steven - Did not make any contributions.
