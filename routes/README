We have encountered some different errors and unexpected issues with our API, as we are needing extra guidance to possibly get this
to work. We have demonstrated other API usage in this file to show that we both understand how API's should work, yet the one for our
project is giving us issues. I think with some extra help, we could get this to work and understand it properly.
